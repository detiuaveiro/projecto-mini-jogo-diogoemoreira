# projecto-mini-jogo-diogoemoreira

This project consists in the making of a mini-game for InMemoriam.

## Rules
     The player must collect the twelve eggs positioned in each level, before a countdown timer reaches zero.  
     In addition there are piles of seed which may be collected to increase points and stop the countdown timer for a while,  
    but will otherwise be eaten by hens that patrol the level.  
     If the player touches a hen or goes outside the map, i.e. falls through a gap in the bottom of the level, he dies.  
     Each level is made of solid platforms and ladders which the player can use to move around.   
## Score

There are different ways to accumulate **score**:  
- Eggs 
- Emu's food  
- Remaining Time
