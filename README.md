# projecto-mini-jogo-diogoemoreira

This project consists in the making of a mini-game for InMemoriam.

## Rules
     The player must collect the eggs positioned in each level, before a countdown timer reaches zero.  
     In addition, there are piles of food which may be collected to increase points  
     but will otherwise be eaten by enemies that patrol the level, which stop for a while after eating them.  
     If the player touches a hen or goes outside the map, i.e., falls through a gap in the bottom of the level, he dies.  
     Each level is made of solid platforms and ladders which the player can use to move around.  

## Score

- Eggs 
- Emu's food
